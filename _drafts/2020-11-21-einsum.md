Einsum summation is a notation for matrix computation. It is extremely effective
(complex computations can be expressed with short expressions). 

For example, 

- Show an example of a calculation that takes a huge amout of lines
- Show the einsum version (wow)

- Explain einsum basics
- More complex use cases ?
- How is it implemented? Is it optimized ? (Compare manual speed vs einsum speed)

- Warning: how to not shoot yourself in the feet: optimize einsum?
